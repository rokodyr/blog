# Exploit Development Concepts

## Overview
Exploit development is studied theoretically to understand how systems fail.

## Topics
- Logic flaws, stack and heap manipulation
- Behavior-based vs bug-based exploitation
- Security mechanisms and bypass principles
- Safe examples and case studies (educational)
- Methodology over execution

## Takeaway
The goal is to learn **how exploits work**, not to weaponize them.
