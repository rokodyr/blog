# System Internals

## Overview
Understanding how systems operate at a low level is essential
for offensive security research. This includes processes, memory,
and kernel vs user-mode behavior.

## Topics
- Process lifecycle and memory management
- Stack, heap, and process behavior
- User-mode vs kernel-mode differences
- Unexpected system behavior analysis
- Preparing system-first thinking for potential vulnerabilities

## Takeaway
Offensive methodology starts with analyzing **how systems actually work**.
